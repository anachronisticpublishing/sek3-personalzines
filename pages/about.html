            <h2>What it's all about.</h2>
<p>We are a group of fans of enthusiasts of late Samuel Edward Konkin III
trying to make his legacy as widely available as humanly possible.
As a part of that effort, we are finding and scanning his personalzines
he published for many years under several titles. Not all of them are
that interesting after all those years, but many can tell us something
about his life and ideas.</p>
<p><a href="../pages/wanted.html">List of zines we’d really, really like to have but don’t.</a></p>
<p>Feel free to ask stuff and remember that sharing our links is the best donation.</p>
<h2>Want to download all at once? Want a different format?</h2>
<p>You can download all the zines from this site using this
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8y91t0zq1gtfwqm/AAAVUXcHdeSjCVlzyYkigqxya?dl=0">DropBox link</a>
— in DJVU and PDF formats, combined into one file or separated.
Contact us if you want our original scans for one reason or another
(they are messy, inconsistent, and would take a lot of disk space though).</p>
<h2>Other projects</h2>
<p>While this project concentrates on fannish, faanish, and other SF-related personalzines,
that’s not all SEK3 has created. He wrote a lot of articles, two books and left several
more unfinished, edited a dozen of zines, newsletters, and other periodicals, maintained
his own personal fanzine. Naturally, we have other projects concentrating on those:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Libertarian articles (some SF-related, but not many) are being found,
  scanned and published on <a href="http://www.sek3.net/">sek3.net</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other fanzines and prozines (<em>New Libertarian</em>
  and others) are being scanned, OCRed, and will be published soon.
  Probably, in addition to webbed articles, there will be
  whole volumes of OCRed zines in eBook format.
  Stay tuned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Books, both finished and unfinished, fiction and non-fiction,
  will soon be available as eBooks (EPUB and Kindle format).
  <em>New Libertarian Manifesto</em> and
  <em>An Agorist Primer</em> are available as print editions,
  thanks to <a href="http://kopubco.com">KoPubCo</a>,
  and PDFs can be found on the web. KoPubCo also works on finishing
  <em>Counter-Economics</em>, the book.
  For everything else, again, stay tuned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to do if you don’t like our site and its content</h2>
<p>Immediately go to facebook or your blog and write a lengthy
angry post about it, don’t forget to include a link to our site.</p>
<p>Please write everything you think about us there, what a stupid
bunch of childish fans we are and how we want to laugh about
everything you believe in. Also feel free to ask you friends to repost
this important information (with our link, of course) all over the web.</p>
<p>But do not contact us about it under any circumstances unless you
want to give us something we need (like if you want to get
rid of some rare anarchist magazines), we have funnier
(and fannier) stuff to do, you know.</p>
